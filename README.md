The programs used at [Testing Scalable Bell Inequalities for Quantum Graph States on IBM Quantum Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10307) by Bo Yang, Rudy Raymond, Hiroshi Imai, Hyungseok Chang, Hidefumi Hiraishi.

These programs computes the quantum correlation of star graph states and path graph states in terms of the Bell inequality by [Scalable Bell inequalities for qubit graph states and robust self-testing](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.020402) by F. Baccari, R. Augusiak, I. Šupić, J. Tura, and A. Acín, on real devices of IBM Quantum Experience.
