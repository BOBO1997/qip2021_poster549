# Brief tests on the computational speed of qiskit.ignis.mitigation.TensoredFitter.apply()

I used n-qubit GHZ state for the benchmark circuit.



## Test for least square method

Size 2 to 7 are examined.

- tensored_filter_original_least_squares.ipynb tests the previous code
- tensored_filter_fixed_least_squares.ipynb tests the modified code

## Test for pseudo inverse method

Size 2 to 12 are examined.

- tensored_filter_original_pseudo_inverse.ipynb tests the previous code 
- tensored_filter_original_pseudo_inverse.ipynb tests the modified code
